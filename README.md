# Overview
This Dash application provides a comprehensive view of sales data through interactive visualizations. It includes heatmaps for units sold, total profit, and cost efficiency, alongside a dynamic time series graph of total revenue by region. This tool is designed to help users explore sales performance across various dimensions and time periods.

# Features
Year Selection: Users can select a year to dynamically update all visualizations to reflect data from that year.
# Heatmaps:
Units Sold: Shows the total units sold by region and item type.
Total Profit: Displays the total profit generated by region and item type.
Cost Efficiency: Visualizes the cost efficiency (total profit divided by total cost) by region and item type.
Time Series Graph: Represents the monthly total revenue by region, providing insights into trends over the selected year.
# Installation
Prerequisites: Before you can run this application, you'll need the following installed:

Python (3.6+ recommended), pip (Python package installer)

Required Libraries: This project depends on several Python libraries, including Dash, Pandas, Plotly, and Matplotlib. You can install all required libraries using pip:

`pip install dash pandas plotly matplotlib`

# Running the Application
To run the application:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the directory containing the project files.
Run the application using Python:

`python app.py`

The Dash application will start on your local server, typically accessible via http://127.0.0.1:8050/.

Usage
After starting the application, you can interact with it through your web browser:

Select a Year: Use the dropdown menu at the top of the dashboard to select a year. The visualizations will update automatically to reflect the data for the chosen year.
View Heatmaps: The heatmaps provide a color-coded view of sales metrics, making it easy to compare different regions and product types.
Analyze Trends: The time series graph at the bottom of the dashboard shows revenue trends over time, helping identify seasonal patterns or growth trends.
Expected Output
Upon selecting a year, the dashboard will display:

Two heatmaps on the top showing units sold and total profit.
A third heatmap below the first showing cost efficiency.
A time series graph on the bottom right showing monthly revenue trends for the selected year.
Each heatmap uses color intensities to represent higher or lower values, and the time series graph uses lines of different colors to distinguish between regions.
